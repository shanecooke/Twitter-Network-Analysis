    "In order to complete this assignment, I have written code which parses in \"friendships.csv\" and \"tweets.jsonl\", cleans the datasets, isolates necessary information, stores this information and plots networks using this data. I have also written code that provides some of the characteristics of these networks, and some of these characteristics are also plotted on graphs. Comments are provided to describe what each line of code does, and mark-down cells are used to describe what each block of code does, and what result we get from running that block.  The specific question being answered by each block of code can be found in the first line of the output after that block has been run and also in the markdown cells."

    "For the above block of code, I began by creating three empty lists necessary for cleaning the dataset and isolating specific lines of data. After this, I used a nested `for` loop to iterate through the list of tweets and isolate the hashtags used in any given tweet. I appended this hashtag to a list of hashtags that had been used, and appended the name of the author of the tweet to another list. I added an `@` sign to the beginning of each user in order to make sure that the network would be bipartite because the screen name of some users where also used as hashtags. I then created a directed graph, and used another `for` loop to add edges between the two previously mentioned lists. If an edge already exists, the weight is increased by one, and if it does not exist it is created with an initial weight of one. Finally, I set the parameters for the network graph and printed it in a spring layout.\\\n",

I then found the number of nodes and edges, along with the density of the network. I also used a query to check whether the network is bipartite or not. I then wrote a small piece of code that outputs the top 10 out-degrees along with a graph representation. Finally, I called four instances of the `top10_attributes` function to print the degree centrality and betweenness centrality of the network."
